# Permissioning

GoQuorum supports two network permissioning models. 

* [Basic network permissioning](BasicNetworkPermissions.md)
    Controls which nodes can connect to a given node and also to which nodes the given node can dial out to.

* [Enhanced network permissioning](Enhanced/EnhancedPermissionsOverview.md)
    Caters for enterprise-level needs by having a **smart contract-based permissioning model**.  This allows
    for significant flexibility to manage nodes, accounts, and account-level access controls.
