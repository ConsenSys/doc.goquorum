# Cakeshop

[Cakeshop](https://github.com/ConsenSys/cakeshop) is a set of tools and APIs for working with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/),
packaged as a Java web application archive (WAR) that gets you up and running quickly.

Cakeshop can be connected to Ethereum-like nodes, such as Quorum, which you can then interact with using the Cakeshop front-end.

Out of the box you get:

* **Blockchain Explorer** - view transactions, blocks and contracts, and see historical contract state at a point in time
* **Node Info** - view the overall status of your network
* **Peer Management** - easily discover, add and remove peers
* **Solidity Sandbox** - develop, compile, deploy and interact with Solidity smart contracts

It provides tools for connecting to multiple nodes, managing peers and permissions,
exploring the state of the chain, and working with contracts.

The Cakeshop package includes a [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
compiler, and all dependencies.
